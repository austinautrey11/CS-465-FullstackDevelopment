# CS-465-FullstackDevelopment
CS 465 Full Stack Development with MEAN
Architecture

Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).

On the frontend side of the application, I worked on the customer facing side of the application which was the travlr getways website. This involved using mostly Express HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Then I also worked on the single page application admin site. This consisted of using angular, and coding in typescript for the first time. Although it was very challenging, and more detailed then working on the customer facing site, it was more rewarding. I beleive working with angular over express created a more user friednly experience.

Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

The backend used a MongoDB database, because we needed a strong database for storage. We especially needed one that could handle high volume. MongoDB gave me the option to accomplish this flawlessly.

Functionality
How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?

JSON is different because it allows us to tie in and share data between the client and server very easily. If we simply just used javascript this would have not been possible. It is based off javascript, but allows us to use similar languages such as javascript which was used on the front end and typescript which was used on the SPA site in order to build a full stack web application.

Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

I refactored code beggining with the intial HTML for each page. I did this by converting the HTML into handlebars. I then created routes and controllers on the front end of the site to better show this functionality. I also refactored several parts for the SPA site in order to enhance the UI through creating a login through auhthentication, a more unique home screen, and a navbar. 

Testing

Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
Reflection
I used postman to perform different requests for testing. This also allowed me to see my errors in real time, and see why certain parts of my application were not particularly working. Some of the requests I used for POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE. Using postman is a very valuable tool I will continue to use along with Robo3T

How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

This course has helped me tremendously. Especially with allowing me to go through the whole process of building a full stack application from start to finish. I learned several new things on the fly such as javascript, typescript, node, angular, and express. Often in the industry we will be expected to pick up new stacks on the fly, and I beleive this has prepared me well for what I will face in the future.
