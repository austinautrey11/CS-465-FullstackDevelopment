CS 465 Full Stack Development with MEAN
I started working on the backend by downloading and implementing mongoose into my code.
I created a new folder called models including two new files travlr.js and and db.js
In the models folder travlr.js was created in order to hold the schema for trips.
The db.js file in the models folder was created in order to manage the connection to the database on the backend.
I used seedgoose to seed the data, and then used Robo3t for testing.
